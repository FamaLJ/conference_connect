          Each year, Kellogg’s Black Management Association Conference brings together students, alumni, faculty and executives to discuss the importance of diversity in thought, experiences and leadership through the lens of the business world. Previous conference speakers include: then U.S. Senator Barack Obama, former CMO of Kraft Deanie Elsner, CNN reporter Soledad O’Brien, and former CEO of the Dallas Mavericks Terdema Ussery.</p>

          <p class="bigp">In celebration of the 30th anniversary, our goal for this year is to pay tribute to the history of the conference, while leveraging the experiences of our speakers to envision a blueprint for success in the future.

          <h4>CEO, Slack</h4>
          <p class="bigp">Before building his $2.8 billion startup Slack, which many consider the fastest-growing business app ever, Stewart Butterfield ran another hot startup called Flickr, which was sold to Yahoo for over $20 million.</p>

            Butterfield is an avid supporter of the power of diverse teams and co-authored his company’s inaugural diversity report in September, 2015 and touches on the idea that hiring diverse candidates isn’t enough; rather, changing the culture must be part of the goal.
